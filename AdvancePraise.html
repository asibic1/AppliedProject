    <p><b>This sensitive memoir about the war in Bosnia in the 1990s will quickly make
readers think about the current conflict in Ukraine: stories of families torn
apart by the horrors and atrocities of war; the miracle of love finding new
hope in mountains of despair. Aida Šibić’s war tragedy, <em>Luck Follows the Brave</em>,
recalls another Bosnian writer, Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić, who, in fiction,
crafted sensitive portraits from the galleries of Bosnian history. Šibić draws
deep from her own well of experience to paint an accurate portrait of contemporary Bosnian history. Read it to weep. Read it to learn. Read it to find your
own pathway through life’s trials to dreams of hope.</b></p>

International Programs at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass
Communication at Arizona State University</b></p>

<p><b><em>Luck Follows the Brave</em> will remind readers of frightening current events now
repeating themselves in Ukraine. As an immigrant myself, I deeply felt Aida
Šibić’s pain, cried alongside her over losing loved ones, and laughed at the
crazy immigrant jokes. Despite being robbed of her childhood, getting divorced, being a single mom with two young children, and losing her mom,
she still managed to make peace with the past, becoming grateful for the life
she lives today. “There are no knights in shining armor that will ride in and
rescue the princess in distress,” she writes. “The princess rescues herself and
writes her own happy ending.”</b></p>

        author of <em>Deportation Impossible</em>, Former Chair of the Immigration Section
of the State Bar of Arizona</b></p>

<p><b>It's unimaginable that one woman could not only survive multiple traumas
but also rise above her experiences with courage and resilience. As a fellow survivor of suicide loss, I could identify with Aida’s story. It resonated
with me. By telling our stories, we can heal and, in turn, inspire others to
not give up, regardless of the circumstances. Aida’s love for her children
reminded me of my own motivation to keep going, despite the emotional
turmoil. I highly recommend <em>Luck Follows the Brave</em>. You will be touched,
moved, and inspired.</b></p>
<p><b>—Cathie Godfrey, author of <em>Your Suicide Didn’t Kill Me: Choosing to Live and
            Love Again After Loss</em></b></p>

<p><b>Aida Sibić’s <em>Luck Follows the Brave</em> is a well-written book that includes important life events from the genocide in Bosnia, though difficult to read at
times. Anyone like me, and the millions of others who have survived genocide or violence in any form, will find it comforting to read about someone
who has gone through a similar experience. Aida’s memoir proves that life
doesn’t have to be only about pain. While sorrow is essential to human life,
it can, and should be, overflowing with joy. Aida’s life is a living witness to
that possibility.</b></p>
